It's difficult to find investor and entrepreneur face many problems in starting his company
and getting investment so this that's how my app will decrease the workload and this app
will help entrepreneurial thinking in society. Like every person have his idea but they don't
execute their idea in reality because of workload or maybe less resource but that's here
my app will work, this app will come together all entrepreneurs and Investors so that if
any person has a unique idea then he/her can empress the investor and can get
investment for his startup and also there will be more entrepreneurs so any entrepreneur
also partnership his company with other entrepreneurs.
Entrepreneurs can get many product reviews and mentorship for starting their company
from other entrepreneurs.
Suppose if any person has a unique idea for a startup but did not have much resources so
he/she can partnership with those two can invest more.
Like Entrepreneur can make his trusted core team having the same vision.
It is an undeniable fact that poverty is the single
greatest source of national shame for India.
Poverty is a complex issue, and complex
problems require imaginative solutions.
Entrepreneurship does not only benefit the
entrepreneur; it also benefits their community.
When a business is created in a community, it
creates local jobs, helps keep money
circulating in the community, and often pulls in
money from other communities.
